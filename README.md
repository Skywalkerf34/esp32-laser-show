# ESP32 Laser Show

This is a very basic laser show driver for the ESP32.

The schematic for the board is here - https://oshwlab.com/chris_9044/laser-show-driver-breadboard

You can watch a video here:

You can either build this on breadboard or get a custom PCB made by JLCPCB.

You'll need a device with PSRAM (or you'll need to remove some of the ILDA files) as currently the files are all loaded into memory before use.

# Building

This project uses PlatformIO and the ESP IDF.
